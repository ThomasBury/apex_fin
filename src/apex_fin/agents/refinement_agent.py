    Execute a given agent with a prompt and return its stringified content.

    This is a utility function to encapsulate the common pattern of running an
    agent and extracting the textual content from its response.

    Parameters
    ----------
    agent : Agent
        An agent object that conforms to the Agno agent interface,
        specifically, it must have a `.run()` method that accepts a prompt
        and returns a `RunResponse` object.
    prompt : str
        Prompt to send to the agent.

    Returns
    -------
    str
        The content of the agent's response, converted to a string and stripped
        of leading/trailing whitespace.

    """
    Generate a report section through an iterative refinement loop.

    This function attempts to produce a high-quality section of a report
    by first generating an initial draft using a specified `generator_fn`
    (or a default analysis agent). It then uses an evaluation agent to
    assess the draft. If the evaluation indicates a need for improvement,
    the process can be repeated up to `max_retries` times.
    The intent is to improve the output quality through a
    generation-evaluation cycle.

    Parameters
    ----------
    ticker : str
        The stock ticker symbol (e.g., 'AAPL') for which the section
        is being generated. This is typically passed to the `generator_fn`.
    generator_fn : Callable[[str], str], optional
        A function that takes a ticker string as input and returns a string
        representing the generated report section. If None, a default
        markdown analysis agent (`build_analysis_agent()`)
        will be used. Defaults to None.
    section_name : str, optional
        A descriptive name for the section being generated (e.g.,
        "company analysis", "competitor overview"). This is used in
        console output during the refinement process. Defaults to "company analysis".
    max_retries : int, optional
        The maximum number of generation and evaluation attempts.
        Defaults to 2.

    Returns
    -------
    str
        The content of the generated section. This will be the first version
        that passes evaluation, or the latest version if `max_retries`
        is reached without passing.
